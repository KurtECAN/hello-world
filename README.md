# hello-world
My first repository on GitHub

My name is Kurt and I live in Montreal, Canada. I am a recent graduate in biomedical engineering and I am looking to launch a career in data science / analytics. 

My goal with GitHub is to learn and improve my skills in programming, particularly in those languages I have learned before (SQL and MatLab), while learning and applying new languages (Tableau, Power BI, R and Java). This will hopefully pave the way to opportunities to enter the field in the future, while being able to meaningfully pursue projects via here to build up a portfolio of my experience. 

Thank you for any help and feedback that you can provide on what I code and share through here.
